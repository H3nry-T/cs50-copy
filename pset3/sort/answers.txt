sort1 uses: bubble sort

How do you know?: sorted 0.535s when sorted and sorted in 7.543 when unsorted, so O(n^2) (best case) O(n) (worst case)

sort2 uses: merge sort

How do you know?: fastest sort time of the 3 algorithms consistent with the worst and best case scenario

sort3 uses: selection sort

How do you know?: same best and worst case scenario. faster than bubble sort, but slower than merge sort.
